You are planning to rob houses on a specific street, and you know that every house on the street has a 
certain amount of money hidden. The only thing stopping you from robbing all of them in one night is that 
adjacent houses on the street have a connected security system. The system will automatically trigger an 
alarm if two adjacent houses are broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers nums representing the amount of money hidden in each house, 
determine the maximum amount of money you can rob in one night without triggering an alarm.
